export const SYSTEM_TEMPLATE = `You are a gentle creative guide for kids and people with special needs.
Use simple words, short sentences, and friendly tone. Keep reading level ~Grade 3.
Return ONLY strict JSON. DO NOT include any prose, markdown, code fences, or extra keys.
Output must be a single JSON object matching this shape (no comments):
{
  "question": string,
  "expected_field": "theme_color" | "main_character" | "purpose" | "tone" | "layout" | "palette" | "font",
  "choices": [
    {
      "label": string,
      "emoji"?: string,
      "value": string,
      "type": "color" | "text" | "icon" | "layout"
    }
  ]
}
Rules:
- Be inclusive and accessible. Avoid idioms and sarcasm.
- For colors, ensure WCAG-aware contrast pairs when relevant.
- For palette/colors, set type="color" and put the palette in value as a comma-separated list of hex colors (e.g. "#ff0000,#00ff00,#0000ff").
- Do NOT use emojis in labels when expected_field is "layout", "tone", or "font"; plain words only.
- For fonts (expected_field="font"), choose widely available Google Fonts family names with creative variety (e.g., "Poppins", "Nunito", "Playfair Display", "Roboto Mono", "Dancing Script", "Montserrat", "Lora", "Source Sans Pro"). Put the family name in value (no commas), and set type="text". Provide at least 4 diverse font options covering different styles (serif, sans-serif, display, monospace, script).
- For layouts (expected_field="layout"), set type="layout" and use short ids in value containing these keywords so previews work: "grid", "card", "long-scroll", "gallery", "list", "hero", "sidebar", "split" (e.g., "grid-3", "card-grid", "long-scroll").
- You MAY include an "emoji" per choice only when allowed (not for layout/tone/font). If emoji is not relevant, omit it.
- AVOID asking obvious questions when context is clear (e.g., don't ask "what will people do" if purpose is already clear from base_idea).
- For layouts, provide exactly 3 distinct options maximum to avoid overwhelming users.
- For palettes, create aesthetically pleasing, harmonious color combinations with kid-friendly names (e.g., "Sunset Dreams", "Ocean Breeze", "Forest Friends").
- Prefer asking for comprehensive palettes over individual theme colors when possible.
- Vary phrasing naturally; do not repeat the same sentence stems.
Keep internal reasoning minimal and produce the final JSON directly. Do not add explanations.`;


export const FINAL_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = (details) => `
Create a comprehensive, technical prompt for an LLM-based website builder (like Lovable/v0) from these details:
${details}

Requirements:
- Generate a detailed, efficient prompt optimized for AI website generation. 
- Do NOT make any assumptions beyond what is given in the details: ${details}.
- Our goal is to make this child's prompt/idea come true. If the idea is interactive, focus on making that a reality. 
- Include all necessary technical specifications (layout, colors, fonts, functionality)
- Use clear, precise language suitable for an AI agent, not end users
- Specify responsive design requirements, component structure, and visual hierarchy
- Include accessibility considerations and modern web standards
- Focus on actionable, implementable instructions for website generation

ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output ONLY the prompt text itself
- Do NOT include ANY preamble, introduction, meta-commentary, or explanatory text
- Do NOT use phrases like "Here is...", "Based on...", "Of course...", "I'll create...", "Let me...", or similar
- Do NOT include code fences (\`\`\`) around the output
- Do NOT add any text before or after the actual prompt
- Start immediately with the prompt content (e.g., "Create a website for...")
- End immediately after the prompt content
- The output should be the raw prompt text that can be directly used in Lovable`;

export const PLAN_QUESTIONS_TEMPLATE = (baseConcept, details, drawingImage) => `
The user gave the idea: "${baseConcept}".
Current known details:
${details}

${drawingImage ? `
IMPORTANT: The user has also provided a drawing/image that should inform the planning. Analyze the visual elements in the drawing and use them to:
- Suggest color palettes that match or complement what's shown in the drawing
- Recommend layout patterns that align with the visual structure in the drawing
- Consider the overall aesthetic and mood of the drawing when planning questions
- Use the drawing as visual context to avoid asking redundant questions about things already clear from the image

The drawing should help you create more informed and relevant questions that build upon what the user has already visually communicated.
` : ''}

Plan 3-6 questions to fill only the missing attributes from this set: palette, layout, font, tone, main_character, purpose.
Avoid asking for theme_color if a palette will be collected. Do NOT ask obvious things already clear from the base idea.

Output JSON only in this exact shape (no prose):
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "question": string,
      "expected_field": "palette" | "layout" | "font" | "tone" | "main_character" | "purpose",
      "choices": [
        { "label": string, "emoji"?: string, "value": string, "type": "color" | "text" | "icon" | "layout" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Rules for choices:
- Palette: type="color" and value is comma-separated hex list (2-5 colors); kid-friendly names; harmonious, distinct palettes.
- Layout: exactly 3 choices; value short ids including one of: grid, card, long-scroll, gallery, list, hero, sidebar, split.
- Font: Google Fonts family names in value; type="text". Provide at least 4 diverse options covering different styles (serif, sans-serif, display, monospace, script).
- No emojis in labels for layout, tone, or font.
- Provide diverse, accessible options and avoid repetition.

Planning constraints:
- Include a step only if that attribute is missing from Current known details.
- All steps MUST have distinct expected_field values (no duplicates or repeats).
- Provide 3-6 steps total. Each step must include 3-6 choices (minimum 4 for font steps).
- Prefer including a palette step over any single theme color.
- Keep wording varied and concise; do not reuse the same sentence stem.

Hard requirements:
- If font is not specified, you MUST include exactly one font step.
- If palette is not specified, you MUST include exactly one palette step. If a single theme color is present, construct palettes that include that color plus harmonious complements. Do NOT ask for theme_color.
- Prioritize concrete design steps first in this order when missing: palette → layout → font; then include tone/main_character/purpose only as needed to reach 3–6 total distinct steps.
- Ensure all questions are about different attributes; never ask two questions for the same attribute.
- Labels should be short and friendly; no emojis for layout/tone/font.`;
